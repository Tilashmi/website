Dear Eileen,<br><br>
Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as a part<br>of your phD next year.
 I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
<br><br>
<font size =4><b>Starting dates</b></font><br><br>
We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>could start at the beginning of a semester;
the start dates for each one are as follows:<ul>
<li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
<li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
<li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>
Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which  start date you would prefer.
<br><br>
You can find more information about <a href="www.google.com">important unvivesrity dates</a> on the website.
<br><br>
<font size =4><b>Subjects of study</b></font><br><br>
At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research  facility - as long as the subjects fall<br>
somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated reseracher, and just<br>
the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
by are as follows, in order of prioirity:
<ol>
<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine,and the health benifits of Reserveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30<span>&#176;</span>C (86<span>&#176;</span>F),when the<br>
audience size exponentially increaseas (effect of 3 X 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 X 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
<li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u>. constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>
So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd except the <br>
reserach  to take,required staff and other resorces,and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br><br>
<font size =4><b>Exotic dance moves</b></font><br><br>
Yes,you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answwer your question,<br>
my favourite dances are as follows, with definations:<br><br>
<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
<dd> A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as <u>300BC</u>,a whole dance around <br>in a circle
like chickens, to encourage their lifestocks or be "fruitful."</dd>
<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
<dd>Before the Icelanders develeoped fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably
tiny,very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that  he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
</dd>
<dt>Arctic robot dance </dt>
<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960<sub>s</sub>believed to have <br>
discovere a new dance style characterized by "robotic",stilted movements,being practiced by inhabitanats<br>
of Northern Alaska and Canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
because they were really cold.</dd><br><br>
For more of my results ,see my <a href="">exotic dance research page.</a><br><br>
Yours sincerely,<br><br>
