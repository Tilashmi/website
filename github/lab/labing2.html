	<p>In North Queensland the big box jellyfish and the irukanji are the most common jellyfish seen during 'stinger season'. 
	It is so venomous it will killyou within two minutes if you receive two metres or more tentacle contact. If a tentacle touches
	the skin it results in a very painful sting</p>
