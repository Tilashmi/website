<li> What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?<br><br></li>
<p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documentslike HTML,
 specially for communication between web browsers and web servers.</p>
 <hr>
<li>Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?<br><br></li>
<p>HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. Though often based
 on a TCP/IP layer, it can be used on any reliable transport layer; that is, a protocol that doesn't lose messages silently, such as UDP.</p>
 <hr>
<li>Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP.<br><br></li>
<p>In client-server protocols, like HTTP, sessions consist of three phases:<br><br>

The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not TCP).<br>
The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.<br>
The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.<br>
As of HTTP/1.1, the connection is no longer closed after completing the third phase, and the client is 
now granted a further request: this means the second and third phases can now be performed any number of times.</p>
<hr>
<li>Describe the parameters on a get and post request.<br><br></li><p>
The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
<br>
1.Request has body	            :No<br>
2.Successful response has body	:Yes<br>
3.Safe	                        :Yes<br>
4.Idempotent	                :Yes<br>
5.Cacheable	                    :Yes<br>
6.Allowed in HTML forms	        :Yes<br>
</p>
<p>
When the POST request is sent via a method other than an HTML form — like via an XMLHttpRequest — the body can take any type. As described in the HTTP 1.1 specification, POST is designed to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:

Annotation of existing resources
Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or similar group of articles;
Adding a new user through a signup modal;
Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process;
Extending a database through an append operation.<br>
1.Request has body	            :Yes<br>
2.Successful response has body	:Yes<br>
3.Safe	                        :No<br>
4.Idempotent	                :No<br>
5.Cacheable	Only if freshness information is included<br>
6.Allowed in HTML forms	        Yes

<li>What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?<br><br></li>
<p>HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.<br>
The HTTP 200 OK success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded.<br>
The best known of them all, the 404 status code indicates that the requested resource was not <br>found at the URL given, and the server has no idea how long for. </p></li>
<hr>
<li> What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.<br><br></li>
<p>An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser
may store it and send it back with the next request to the same server. Typically, it's used to tell if two requests came from the
same browser — keeping a user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful<br> information for the stateless HTTP protocol.</p>
<hr>
<li> Why are cookies a security issue??<br><br></li>
<p>Information should be stored in cookies with the understanding that all cookie values will be visible to and can be changed by the
end-user. Depending on the application, it may be desirable to use an opaque identifier which is looked-up server-side or investigate
alternative authentication/confidentiality mechanisms such as JSON Web Tokens.</p>
<hr>
<li> Describe session hijacking and XSS<br><br></li>
<p>Cookies are often used in web application to identify a user and their authenticated session, so stealing a cookie can lead to
hijacking the authenticated user's session. Common ways to steal cookies include Social Engineering or exploiting an XSS vulnerability
in the application.</p>
<hr>
<li> Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)<br><br></li>
<p>Wikipedia mentions a good example for CSRF. In this situation, someone includes an image that isn’t really an image 
(for example in an unfiltered chat or forum), instead it really is a request to your bank’s server to withdraw money</p>
<hr>
<li> What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?<br><br></li>
<p>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application
running at one origin (domain) have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin. A web application executes a
 cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, and port) than its own origin.<br><br>
This cross-origin sharing standard is used to enable cross-site HTTP requests for:
Invocations of the XMLHttpRequest or Fetch APIs in a cross-site manner, as discussed above.
Web Fonts (for cross-domain font usage in @font-face within CSS), so that servers can deploy TrueType fonts that can only be cross-site loaded and used by web sites that are permitted to do so.
WebGL textures.
Images/video frames drawn to a canvas using drawImage().</p>
